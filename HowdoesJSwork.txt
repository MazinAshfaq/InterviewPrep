Javascript engine - v8

The engine consists of two parts

Memory Heap
    here memory allocation happens
    
    Memory Leak {
    Happen when you have unused memory, laying around
    and it fills up memory heap.
    }

Call stack
    Where the code is read and executed. 



Javascript is a single threaded language that can be nonn-blocking??
    Single threaded means it only has one call stack, it can only execute 
    from one call stack, whatever code is first, FIFO basically. Other languages 
    can have multiple call stacks, multi threaded. Javascript is single thread is easier
    since we only have one call stack.  

    In multi thread enviorments we can have deadlocks. 

    Synchronous programming is where the code executed one by one. Down the stack.

    Stack overflow is when the stack gets too big to fit in the stack. This can be caused by
    unlimited recurssion. 

    Asynchronous is like a behavior,
