Arrays organzize data in memory sequentially.
Simplist & Widley Used. 
Smallest Footprint.

Lookup : O(1)
Push   : O(1)
Insert : O(n)
Delete : O(n)


Dynamic vs Static Arrays
------------------------
Static Array is predefined size.

Dynamic Array allows for array to be expanded by
copying and reallocating memory. 

Dynamic memory needs memory management, c++ allows for memory management
while higher levels like JS do not. 

Sometimes the push command can change time complexity from constant to linear
if the array has to be copied and reallocated when it needs more space. This is for
dynamic arrays. 
Push   : O(1) -----> O(n)

Interview tip: Turn strigns into arrays, using spit();


Pros:
Fast lookups
Fast Push/Pop
Ordered

Cons:
Slow Insert
Slow Delete
Fixed Size is static
