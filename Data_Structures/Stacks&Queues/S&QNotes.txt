Linear data structures.
Traverse data sequentially, only one data element can be directly reached

Main difference between stacks and queues is how elements get popped.
Can only access first or last elements.
Higher level data structures.

Benefit is to restrict user operations, instead of full access to underlying datastructure.

stacks
-----------
Last in first out.
Example like a stack of plates.
Can only access top plate.

queues
--------
first in first out
example like a line of people

Lookup is O(n) on both data structures
the rest of the operations are O(1)
