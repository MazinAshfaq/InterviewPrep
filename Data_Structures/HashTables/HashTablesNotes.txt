Hash Tables and Arrays most common interview questions


Lookup : O(1)
Push   : O(1)
Insert : O(1)
Delete : O(1)


Most languages have hastables built in...

Python --> dict
JS ---> Objects
Java ---> maps
ruby --> hashes

Hash tables use Key Value pairs
Key is used as index for where to find in memory
Key is passed to hash function, memory address generated

Benefit of Hash is very fast lookup. 
Given a key, we know exactly where it is in memory
Hash functions need to be quick... 

What is a Hash Function?
----------------------------------------
Simply a function that generates a value of fixed length, for each input it recieves.
Hash functions are one way..
It is a One to One function... (indemponent)



What is a Hash Collision?
----------------------------------------
Nothing tells a hash function to evenly distribute values

Hash collision happens when two keys assigned to same address space.

Collision slows down reading and writing to O(n)

Two common ways to solve collision, one is to create a linked list... called sperating chaining

In ES6 javascript we have 

Maps ----> const a = new Map();
Sets ----> const b = new Sets();

Maps allow for any data type to be saved as a KEY. Objects in JS are only allowed to store strings as keys. 
Sets only store the Key.


Array vs HashTable
---------------------------------------
Faster Search and Insert both O(n)






Pros
Fast lookups
fast inserts
flexible keys

cons
unordered
slow key itteration
